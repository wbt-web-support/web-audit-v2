# Payment Flow Test Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Payment Success API Authentication
- **Problem**: User authentication was failing in server-side context
- **Solution**: Added service client authentication with user_id fallback
- **Files**: `app/api/payment-success/route.ts`

### 2. Plans API Fetch Error
- **Problem**: Plans API was failing with fetch errors
- **Solution**: Updated Supabase client configuration to use direct client creation
- **Files**: `app/api/plans/route.ts`

### 3. Payment History API Authentication
- **Problem**: Payment history API was getting 401 errors
- **Solution**: Updated to use service client for database operations
- **Files**: `app/api/payment-history/route.ts`

### 4. User Plan Update
- **Problem**: User plan wasn't being properly updated after payment
- **Solution**: Enhanced user plan update with comprehensive data including:
  - Plan type and ID
  - Max projects and features
  - Plan expiration dates
  - Subscription ID
- **Files**: `app/api/payment-success/route.ts`

## Test Steps

### 1. Test Plans Loading
1. Navigate to pricing page
2. Check browser console for "Database plans loaded" message
3. Verify plans are displayed (not fallback)

### 2. Test Payment Flow
1. Click on a paid plan
2. Complete Razorpay payment
3. Check browser console for success messages
4. Verify user plan is updated in database

### 3. Test Payment History
1. Navigate to dashboard
2. Check if payment history loads without 401 errors
3. Verify payment records are displayed

### 4. Test User Plan Update
1. After successful payment, check user table in database
2. Verify `plan_type`, `plan_id`, `max_projects`, `can_use_features` are updated
3. Check `plan_expires_at` is set correctly

## Expected Results

- ✅ Plans load from database (not fallback)
- ✅ Payment success API authenticates user properly
- ✅ User plan is updated with comprehensive data
- ✅ Payment history API works without 401 errors
- ✅ No console errors during payment flow

## Database Schema Requirements

Ensure these columns exist in the `users` table:
- `plan_type` (text)
- `plan_id` (uuid)
- `max_projects` (integer)
- `can_use_features` (jsonb)
- `plan_expires_at` (timestamp)
- `subscription_id` (text, nullable)

## API Endpoints Fixed

1. **GET /api/plans** - Now uses direct Supabase client
2. **POST /api/payment-success** - Enhanced authentication and user plan update
3. **GET /api/payment-history** - Uses service client for database operations

## Monitoring

Check these logs for successful operation:
- "Database plans loaded: X plans"
- "User authenticated via service client with user_id"
- "User plan updated successfully with plan type: [PLAN_TYPE]"
- "Payment processed successfully"
